            <strong>John Mayer</strong>, in full John Clayton Mayer, (born October 16, 1977, Bridgeport,
            Connecticut,
            U.S.), American singer, songwriter, and guitarist whose melodic, often soft rock earned him a wide
            audience
            and a number of Grammy Awards in the early 21st century.

            Having taken up guitar playing as a teenager, Mayer briefly attended Boston’s Berklee College of Music
            but
            never completed his studies. Moving to Atlanta, Georgia, he played frequently in local clubs with a band
            and
            as a solo act. In 1999 he independently released his debut EP, Inside Wants Out. After a 2000
            performance at
            the South by Southwest music festival in Austin, Texas, he signed with the Aware record label, which
            released the full-length album Room for Squares (2001). Columbia Records repackaged the album with
            additional material for a much higher-profile national release later in 2001. The songs “No Such Thing”
            and
            “Your Body Is a Wonderland” both became hits, and the latter earned Mayer a Grammy Award for best male
            pop
            vocal performance. Mayer’s next studio release, Heavier Things (2003), topped the Billboard album chart
            and
            featured the hit “Daughters,” which was honoured with two Grammy Awards, including song of the year.

            Having established himself as a major presence in the world of adult-oriented alternative rock, Mayer
            sought
            to broaden the scope of his sound. Incorporating his long-standing interest in the blues, he formed the
            John
            Mayer Trio, and he collaborated with rappers Common and Kanye West. Continuum (2006), reflecting this
            new
            approach, was another commercial success. It also earned Mayer a Grammy for best pop vocal album, and
            its
            single “Waiting on the World to Change” won for best male pop vocal performance. He continued to be a
            Grammy
            favourite in 2009, picking up another award for best male pop vocal performance (for the single “Say,”
            from
            Continuum) and one for best solo rock performance (for “Gravity,” from the 2008 live album Where the
            Light
            Is). <br>
