  <p>One of the best practices a Software Engineer or a programmer should have, is keeping their code clean, simple and easy to understand.
    Simplifying codes will make it easier to find faults in the code, as a result, it will make them easier to fix and easier for others to understand them. It is also important to test your codes to
    determine if they work or if they are compatible with different browsers.</p>
