            <h2 id="about-title">Chadwick Boseman</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Chadwick Aaron Boseman (November 29, 1976 – August 28, 2020) was an American actor. 
                After studying directing at Howard University, he landed his first major role as a 
                series regular on Persons Unknown (2010). Boseman's breakthrough performance came as baseball player 
                Jackie Robinson in the biographical film 42 (2013). He continued to portray historical figures, 
                starring in Get on Up (2014) as singer James Brown and Marshall (2017) as Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall.</p>
            <p>Boseman achieved international fame for playing superhero Black Panther in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) 
                from 2016 to 2019. He appeared in four MCU films, including an eponymous 2018 film that earned him an NAACP 
                Image Award for Outstanding Actor in a Motion Picture and a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by 
                a Cast in a Motion Picture. As the first black actor to headline an MCU film, Boseman was also named to the 2018 
                Time 100. In 2020, he starred in Spike Lee's Da 5 Bloods. His final film, Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, was released posthumously, 
                and won him widespread critical acclaim.</p>
            <p>In 2016, Boseman was diagnosed with colon cancer. Boseman kept his condition private, 
                continuing to act while receiving treatment. He died in 2020 from complications related to the illness.</p>
            
            <h2 id="about-title">Tributes</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Governor of South Carolina Henry McMaster ordered the Statehouse flags be lowered to half-staff on August 30, 2020, 
                in honor of Boseman, who was born and raised in the state. Also on August 30, ABC (which, like Marvel Entertainment, 
                is owned by Disney) aired a commercial-free version of Black Panther, followed by a special about Boseman's life and 
                work titled Chadwick Boseman — A Tribute for a King. The 2020 MTV Video Music Awards ceremony was also dedicated to Boseman. 
                On August 28, 2020, a Change.org petition was started, seeking to replace a Confederate monument in his hometown of Anderson 
                with a statue of Boseman, which collected more than 50,000 signatures within less than a week, surpassing its original goal 
                of 15,000 signatures. On September 24, 2020, Disney unveiled a mural by artist Nikkolas Smith dedicated to Boseman at Downtown
                 Disney in Anaheim, California.</p>
            <p>A public memorial service was held on September 4, 2020, in Anderson, South Carolina, where the speakers included Boseman's 
                childhood pastor as well as Deanna Brown-Thomas, daughter of James Brown, whom Boseman portrayed in Get on Up. The city announced 
                plans for creation of a permanent art memorial. Despite reports Boseman was buried at Welfare Baptist Church cemetery in nearby 
                Belton, South Carolina, the funeral home handling his services and the church pastor both denied this. Marvel's official YouTube 
                channel released a tribute for Chadwick Boseman with many actors like Robert Downey Jr, Scarlett Johansson and Chris Evans releasing 
                their tribute. The 2020 video game Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales features an after-credits message dedicated in memory of 
                Boseman and 42nd Street has been renamed to 'Boseman Way' in tribute.[citation needed] On November 29, 2020, Marvel changed the 
                studio's logo animation in the opening of Black Panther on Disney+ to include images of Boseman from the film, as well as his 
                appearances in Captain America: Civil War, Avengers: Infinity War, and Avengers: Endgame, to honor what would have been Boseman's 
                44th birthday.</p>

            <h2 id="about-title">Career</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Boseman acted on stage in multiple productions, winning an AUDELCO award in 2002, and he also directed and wrote plays. 
                Part of the Hip Hop theater movement, his play-writing included Rhyme Deferred (co-writer and performer), 
                and Hieroglyphic Graffiti. Boseman's script for Deep Azure was commissioned by the Congo Square Theatre Company in Chicago, 
                and was nominated for a 2006 Joseph Jefferson Award for New Work.[28][23] He directed a number of theater productions, and 
                directed, wrote, and produced the short film, Blood Over a Broken Pawn in 2007, which was honored at the 2008 Hollywood Black 
                Film Festival.</p>
            <p>In 2003, Boseman was cast in his first television role, an episode of Third Watch.[30] That same year, Boseman portrayed Reggie Montgomery in the daytime soap opera All My Children,[31] but stated that he was fired after voicing concerns to producers about racist stereotypes in the script; the role was subsequently re-cast, with Boseman's future Black Panther co-star Michael B. Jordan assuming the role.[32] His early work included episodes of the series Law & Order, Cold Case, CSI: NY, and ER.[8] In 2008, he played a recurring role on the television series Lincoln Heights and appeared in his first feature film, The Express: The Ernie Davis Story, as running back Floyd Little.[33] He landed his first regular role in the 2010 television series Persons Unknown.[33]</p>
            <p>Boseman's breakthrough role was in the 2013 film 42, in which he portrayed baseball pioneer and star Jackie Robinson.[33][34] He had been directing an off-Broadway play in East Village when he auditioned for the role,[35] and was considering giving up acting and pursuing directing full-time at the time.[36] About 25 other actors had been seriously considered for the role, but director Brian Helgeland liked Boseman's bravery and cast him after he had auditioned twice.[37][18] Robinson's widow, Rachel Robinson, commented that Boseman's performance was like seeing Jackie again.[26] The same year, Boseman also starred in the independent film The Kill Hole, which was released in theaters a few weeks before 42.[38]</p>  
            <p>As James Brown in 2014's Get on Up, Boseman did some singing and all of his own dancing.[39] He watched Brown's performances for weeks, and spoke with Mick Jagger before deciding to portray 'The Hardest Working Man in Show Business'. According to Irish Times film correspondent, Donald Clarke, "Get on Up tested every weapon in the actor’s arsenal...The performance confirmed that, like a star from Hollywood’s golden age, Chadwick Boseman could do it all and do it all with style."[40]</p>
