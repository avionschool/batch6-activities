            <h2>Think slow, learn fast!</h2>
            <p>I know this may sound like a paradox and confusing but let me explain this. The reason why I love this
                quote
                is that it hits me right in the gut. When I was younger, I always do things fast and think fast without
                thinking too much into the problem and without understanding what it teaches me. I just want to do it
                fast
                so that I can feel that I have done something, but that is not the case. When I did that, I didn't
                understand the process it teaches and it only got me confused even more. When I first heard about this
                or
                read this, at first I didn't practice it, but when I did, I learned and understood faster than before.
                Thinking slow is being in the moment of understanding what the problem is and thinking of what it
                actually
                means. With that, you will learn more about the problem by thinking deeply into it. So think slow, and
                learn
                fast!</p>
