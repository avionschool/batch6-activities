            <p>Web developers are at the forefront of the Internet age. 
                The websites we browse, the gifts we order and the news 
                we peruse online are all made possible by the web developers who design, 
                build and implement Internet websites. They are heavily involved in website creation, 
                from helping design aesthetic properties such as layout and color, to technical considerations 
                such as how to design a website to handle a given amount of Internet traffic.</p>

                <p>Not only is the web development field exciting and on the forefront of the digital age,

                    different career paths, current market trends, and what people can expect as a web developer professional.</p>

            <h1>WHAT DOES A WEB DEVELOPER DO?</h1>
            <p>Front-end developers (also known as client-side development) use a variety of programming languages and frameworks such as HTML, 
                CSS and JavaScript to build the exterior look and features of a site. Back-end developers use programming languages 
                such as Python and Ruby to design, build and integrate applications from front-end development into the back end—in other words, they make the features on the site operate. 
                Individuals with skills in both front- and back-end development are known as “full-stack developers.”</p>
