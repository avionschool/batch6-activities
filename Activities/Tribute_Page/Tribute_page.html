                        History:
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        George Walton Lucas Jr. was born on May 14, 1944 in Modesto, California. 
                        Before young Lucas became obsessed with the movie camera, he wanted to be a race car driver, but a near-fatal accident changed his mind. 
                        He attended community college and developed a passion for cinematography and camera tricks. 
                        Following the advice of a friend, he transferred to the University of Southern California's film school.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After graduating from the University of Southern California in 1967, 
                        Lucas co-founded American Zoetrope with filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola. 
                        Lucas wrote and directed THX 1138 (1971), which was a critical success but a financial failure. 
                        His next work as a writer-director was the film American Graffiti (1973), 
                        inspired by his youth in the early 1960s Modesto, California, and produced through the newly founded Lucasfilm. 
                        The film was critically and commercially successful and received five Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lucas's next film, the epic space opera Star Wars (1977), had a troubled production but was a surprise hit, 
                        becoming the highest-grossing film at the time, winning six Academy Awards and sparking a cultural phenomenon. 
                        Lucas produced and co-wrote the sequels The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983). 
                        With director Steven Spielberg, he created, produced, and co-wrote the Indiana Jones films Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), 
                        The Temple of Doom (1984), The Last Crusade (1989) and The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 1997, Lucas re-released the Star Wars Trilogy as part of a special edition featuring several alterations; 
                        home media versions with further changes were released in 2004 and 2011. 
                        He returned to directing with a Star Wars prequel trilogy comprising 
                        Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace (1999), 
                        Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones (2002) and 
                        Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith (2005). 
                        He last collaborated on the CGI-animated television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008–2014, 2020), 
                        the war film Red Tails (2012), and the CGI film Strange Magic (2015).

                    The Original Trilogy consists of the first three films released between 1977 to 1983. 
                    These are “A New Hope” (1977), “The Empire Strikes Back” (1980), and “Return of the Jedi” (1983). 
                    They primarily focus on the Rebel Alliance trying to free the galaxy from the clutches of the Galactic Empire, 
                    as well as Luke Skywalker's quest to become a Jedi and face Sith Lord Darth Vader. 
                    Famous scenes from the trilogy include A New Hope’s “Battle of Yavin” which covers the Rebellion’s desperate assault on the first Death Star, 
                    The Empire Strikes Back’s surprise reveal of Luke’s relation to Darth Vader, and Return of the Jedi’s “Battle of Endor”, 
                    during which Luke confronts the Empire’s ruler Emperor Palpatine and redeems his father Darth Vader.

                <p>
                    The original Star Wars film was released to critical acclaim and was a huge summer blockbuster. 
                    The success of the first film led to it becoming a pop-cultural phenomenon spawning countless 
                    TV spin-offs and films. Along with a multi-merchandise empire including toys, books, video games, T-shirts, etc. 
                    It was then proceeded by two instalments, The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983), 
                    which were also both very successful, with the latter's climax, where Vader's reveal as Luke's father, 
                    became one of the most iconic plot twists in motion picture history.

                    The prequel trilogy is the second installment of films of the Star Wars saga to be produced. 
                    They were released from 1999 to 2005. These are “The Phantom Menace” (1999), “Attack of the Clones” (2002), 
                    and “Revenge of the Sith” (2005). 
                    The prequel trilogy describes what had taken place 32 years up to 19 years before the events of A New Hope. 
                    It primarily focuses on a young Darth Vader, then Jedi Anakin Skywalker, 
                    and an accompanying Obi-Wan Kenobi and the story of how they went from being friends to enemies 
                    and the tragedy of Anakin's descent into the dark side, 
                    as well as the origin of how the Galactic Republic became the Galactic Empire.

                <p>
                    The prequel trilogy received mixed reviews, generally transitioning from negative to positive with each installment. 
                    Common criticisms surrounded the over-reliance on computer-generated imagery and green screens, 
                    melodramatic and wooden dialogue including scenes of romance between Anakin and Padmé, slow-paced political scenes, 
                    and the comic relief character of Jar Jar Binks. Conversely, some argue for the prequel trilogy's positive elements, 
                    including its handling of political issues, especially involving the rise of fascism. Additionally, 
                    the animated The Clone Wars series has been noted to have retroactively improved the perception of the prequel trilogy among fans.

                    Effects on the Film Industry
                </h3>
                <p>
                    It is no exaggeration to say that George Lucas’ contribution to the development of modern cinema is immense. 
                    George Lucas has not only changed the way we experience film and filmmaking, 
                    but also revolutionized film industry practices and standards. He was the first to write, produce, 
                    and direct the modern day high-concept blockbuster (Star Wars) and was the first to create the film franchise (Star Wars trilogy, 
                    Indiana Jones series) which changed the way films are made in Hollywood. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most visible impact he has is with regard to props and specials effects. 
                    He is the founder of Industrial Light & Magic, a company which specializes in special effects 
                    and is instrumental in making Lucas’ vision a reality. They pioneered the Dykstraflex, 
                    the first motion-controlled camera system that could be programmed by computer, 
                    which meant that dynamic spaceship maneuvers with stationary models could be reliably performed time after time. 
                    Star Wars was also the first major film franchise to attempt to include photo-realistic CGI characters 
                    mixed in alongside real practical effects and actors.

                    Impact on Culture
                </h3>
                <p>
                    George Lucas's science fiction multi-film Star Wars saga has had a significant impact on modern popular culture. 
                    Star Wars references are deeply embedded in popular culture with references to the main characters and themes of 
                    Star Wars are casually made in many English-speaking countries with the assumption that others will understand the reference. 
                    Darth Vader has become an iconic villain, while characters such as Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia, C-3PO, R2-D2, 
                    and Chewbacca have all become widely recognized characters around the world. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many efforts produced in the science fiction genre can now be seen to draw heavy influence and inspiration from 
                    the original Star Wars trilogy, as well as the magnitude of sequels, spin-offs, series, games, and texts that it spawned.
                    Sounds, visuals, and even the iconic score of the films have become integral components in American society. 
                    The film helped launch the science fiction boom of the late 1970s and early 1980s, making science fiction films a 
                    blockbuster genre This impact also made it a prime target for parody works and homages.

                    In 1991, The George Lucas Educational Foundation was founded as a nonprofit operating foundation to 
                    celebrate and encourage innovation in schools. Lucas, through his foundation, was one of the leading proponents 
                    of the E-rate program in the universal service fund, which was enacted as part of the 
                    Telecommunications Act of 1996. On June 24, 2008, Lucas testified before the 
                    United States House of Representatives subcommittee on Telecommunications and the 
                    Internet as the head of his Foundation to advocate for a free wireless broadband educational network.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In 2012, Lucas sold Lucasfilm to The Walt Disney Company for a reported sum of $4.05 billion. 
                    It was widely reported at the time that Lucas intends to give the majority of the proceeds from 
                    the sale to charity. Lucas on the matter: "For 41 years, the majority of my time and money has been 
                    put into the company. As I start a new chapter in my life, it is gratifying that I have the opportunity 
                    to devote more time and resources to philanthropy."
                </p>

                <p>
                    In 2005, Lucas gave US$1 million to help build the Martin Luther King Jr. 
                    Memorial on the National Mall in Washington D.C. to commemorate American civil rights 
                    leader Martin Luther King Jr.
                </p>

                <p>
                    On September 19, 2006, USC announced that Lucas had donated $175–180 million to his alma mater to expand the film school. 
                    It is the largest single donation to USC and the largest gift to a film school anywhere. 
                    Previous donations led to the already-existing George Lucas Instructional Building and Marcia Lucas Post-Production building.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In 2013, Lucas and his wife Mellody Hobson donated $25 million to the Chicago-based not-for-profit After School Matters, 
                    of which Hobson is the chair.
                </p>

                <p>
