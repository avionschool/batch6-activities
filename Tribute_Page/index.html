                  <h5>Who is He?</h5>
                  <p>Elon Musk is the co-founder of PayPal, Tesla Motors and SolarCity, and the founder of SpaceX and The Boring Company.
                     His astounding success has given rise to comparison of Musk to Steve Jobs, Henry Ford, Howard Hughes and Bill Gates.
                    Due to his difficult childhood, Elon Musk developed a relentless work ethic and tenacious single-minded vision, which I believe
                    led him to his success.

              <p>In 2001, Musk conceptualized "Mars Oasis", a project to land a miniature experimental greenhouse containing seeds with dehydrated gel on Mars to grow plants on Martian soil, "so this would be the furthest that life's ever traveled"
               in an attempt to regain public interest in space exploration and increase the budget of NASA. But Musk realized that even with a much larger space budget, travel to Mars would be prohibitively expensive without a fundamental breakthrough in rocket technology.
                Musk decided to start a company that could build affordable rockets. With $100 million of his early fortune,[70] Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies Corp., traded as SpaceX, in May 2002.

            <h5 >The Boring Company</h5>
            <p>On December 17, 2016, while stuck in traffic, Musk tweeted "[I] am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging ..." He then founded 'The Boring Company' (TBC).
              The Boring Company's projects are designed for loop intra-city transit systems. Musk cited difficulty with Los Angeles traffic and what he sees as limitations with the current two-dimensional transportation network as his early inspiration for the project.
              The Boring Company was initially formed as a subsidiary of SpaceX, becoming a separate and fully independent company in 2018.

            <h5>NeuraLink</h5>
            <p>Neuralink Corporation is an USA neurotechnology company founded by Elon Musk and others, developing implantable brainâ€“machine interfaces (BMIs).
              In April 2017, the blog Wait But Why reported that the company was aiming to make devices to treat serious brain diseases in the short-term, with the eventual goal of human enhancement, sometimes called transhumanism.
              Musk said his interest in the idea partly stemmed from the science fiction concept of "neural lace" in the fictional universe in The Culture, a series of 10 novels by Iain M. Banks.

              <p>Founded in July 2003 as Tesla Motors, the company's name is a tribute to inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. Elon Musk,
                 who contributed most of the funding in the early days, has served as CEO since 2008. According to Musk, the purpose of Tesla is to help expedite 
                 the move to sustainable transport and energy, obtained through electric vehicles and solar power.
